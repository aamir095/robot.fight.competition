# National Robot Fighting Competition

We were  national robot fighting champions for two consecutive years in 2015 and 2016. The winning memory is still fresh in my mind. Winning these tournaments gave me confidence and boosted me to delve into the field of electronics and embedded systems.

Two robots are kept in the white arena as shown in the figure below. They operate autonomously and try to push other out of the arena. That robot that can push the other out of the arena will be a winner.

ATmega32 is the main processor of the robot with different sensors like an ultrasonic sensor,  IR infrared sensor, and motor driver. The robot should automatically locate the presence of another robot and push it out of the arena. The infrared sensor helps the robot to be inside the arena all the time.

The name of our Robot was "Alpha Male".

We won the competition and got an opportunity to talk with the National Media. Happy Us. Later that night we were on the national television news. Proud moment for our team.

Everything has its time. Our Robo "Alpha Male"  was dismantled. May its soul rest in peace forever.  We miss you.
